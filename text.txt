What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a distributed version control tool that can manage a development project's source code
history, while GitHub is a cloud-based platform built around the Git tool. Git is a tool a
developer installs locally on their computer, while GitHub is an online service that stores code
pushed to it from computers running the Git tool. The key difference between Git and GitHub
is that Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while
GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or
download resources.
